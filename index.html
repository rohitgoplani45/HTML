                    Retro songs plays a major role in my life. Irrespective of which singer is singing , it affects me by the most meaningful lyrics ever. While listening to retro songs it personally tells me the meanings of life. I personally notice that there is very low background voice in retro songs and that too with old instruments like violin , tabla , trumpet , flute and many more. Low background voice makes me a better listener to capture the beauty of the instruments, it makes me a better listener towards the voice of the singer , the lyrics of the song and to get know the importance and relatibility of those songs in today's life. Listening to old songs helps me in understanding the true meaning of life.
